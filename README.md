# SelfLearning

This repo is for self learning about the golang.
I am going to learn golang from zero.
At the same time, I want to pick up and continue learning using github.

Here, I may organize my project as:
1. foundamental skills.
2. API notes.
3. Leetcode practices.

After that, I am planning to start a project myself. Topic? I will choose then.
